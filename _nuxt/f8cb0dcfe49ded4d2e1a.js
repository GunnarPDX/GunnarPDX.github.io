The user starts with a product\n    which has a series of images, in this case the app takes Filestack image handles that the user has uploaded to\n    create the image library. The user can then create cropped image tags which contain useful bits of text\n    information from the products images.  Once the image tags are created and submitted they can be processed\n    through Google Vision's OCR API or manually transcribed by hand.
